# Project-1-ZUM

## Information

I tried to download 2 datasets here (about war and about anime) and only 1 (anime because another one had problem with labeling, too much 1 or 0) was used.
I don't know why we need too many tweets because we have some system limitations and I had a lot of error relatet to memory (not enough)
All work, except for uploading datasets, was done in google colab. It took more than 8 hours to download the datasets (in general, most of the data turned out to be useless).

## Instruction

In order for everything to work, you need to run everything in order. Before starting, I recommend changing the paths.
Everything worked without problems on 05/24/2023 (there were simply problems after a certain time in the working code)
